* 	This is useful though. Some protected content is not associated with an ID. In those cases, URI Restrictions are all the matter.

* ```
*
* ———— Extra Detail On Function Parameters ————
*
* **Parameter $config ( array Required ).** This should be an array with one or more of the following elements.
*
* 	o ``"file_download" => "file.zip"`` Location of the file, relative to the `/s2member-files/` directory; or, relative to the root of your Amazon® S3 Bucket, when applicable.
* 	o ``"file_download_key" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will return a URL with an s2Member-generated File Download Key. You don't need to generate the File Download Key yourself, s2Member does it for you. If you set this to `ip-forever`, the File Download Key that s2Member generates will last forever, for a specific IP Address; otherwise, by default, all File Download Keys expire after 24 hours automatically. If you set this to `universal`, s2Member will generate a File Download Key that is good for anyone/everyone forever, with NO restrictions on who/where/when a file is accessed *( e.g. be careful with this one )*.
* 	o ``"file_stream" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will return a URL containing a parameter/directive, which forces the File Download to take place over the RTMP protocol. This ONLY works when/if s2Member is configured to run with both Amazon® S3/CloudFront. Please note however, it's better to use the example code provided in the your Dashboard. See: `s2Member -> Download Options -> JW Player® and the RTMP Protocol`. Also note, if ``$get_streamer_array`` is passed, s2Member will automatically force ``"file_stream" => true`` for you.
* 	o ``"file_inline" => null`` Defaults to `null`. If `true`, s2Member will serve the file inline, instead of as an actual File Download. If empty, s2Member will look at your Inline File Extensions configuration, and serve the file inline; if, and only if, its extension matches one found in your configuration. By default, s2Member serves all files as attachments *( i.e. downloads )*. Please check your Dashboard regarding Inline File Extensions. Also note, this Shortcode Attribute does NOTHING for files served via Amazon® CloudFront. See the tech-notes listed in the Amazon® CloudFront section of your Dashboard for further details and workarounds.
* 	o ``"file_storage" => null`` Defaults to `null`. Can be one of `local|s3|cf`. When specified, s2Member will serve the file from a specific source location. For example, if you've configured Amazon® S3 and/or CloudFront; but, there are a few files that you want to upload locally to the `/s2member-files/` directory; you can force s2Member to serve a file from local storage by setting ``"file_storage" => "local"`` explicitly.
* 	o ``"file_remote" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will authenticate access to the File Download via Remote Header Authorization, instead of through your web site. This is similar to `.htaccess` protection routines of yester-year. Please check the Remote Authorization and Podcasting section in your Dashboard for further details about how this works.
* 	o ``"file_ssl" => null`` Defaults to `null`. If `true`, s2Member will generate a File Download URL with an SSL protocol *( i.e. the URL will start with `https://` or `rtmpe://` )*. If `null`, s2Member will only generate a File Download URL with an SSL protocol, when/if the Post/Page/URL, is also being viewed over SSL. Otherwise, s2Member will use a non-SSL protocol by default.
* 	o ``"file_rewrite" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will generate a File Download URL that takes full advantage of s2Member's Advanced Mod Rewrite functionality. If you're running an Apache web server, or another server that supports `mod_rewrite`, we highly recommend turning this on. s2Member's `mod_rewrite` URLs do NOT contain query string parameters, making them more portable/compatible with other software applications and/or plugins for WordPress®.
* 	o ``"file_rewrite_base" => null`` Defaults to `null`. If set to a URL, starting with `http` or another valid protocol, s2Member will generate a File Download URL that takes full advantage of s2Member's Advanced Mod Rewrite functionality, and it will use the rewrite base URL as a prefix. This could be useful on some WordPress® installations that use advanced directory structures. It could also be useful for site owners using virtual directories that point to `/s2member-files/`. Note, if `rewrite_base` is set, s2Member will automatically force ``"rewrite" => true`` for you.
* 	o ``"skip_confirmation" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will generate a File Download URL which contains a directive, telling s2Member NOT to introduce any JavaScript confirmation prompts on your site, for this File Download URL. Please note, s2Member will automatically detect links, anywhere in your content, and/or anywhere in your theme files, that contain `s2member_file_download` or `s2member-files`. Whenever a logged-in Member clicks a link that contains `s2member_file_download` or `s2member-files`, the system will politely ask the User to confirm the download using a very intuitive JavaScript confirmation prompt, which contains specific details about your configured download limitations. This way your Members will be aware of how many files they've downloaded in the current period; and they'll be able to make a conscious decision about whether to proceed with a specific download or not.
* 	o ``"url_to_storage_source" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will generate a File Download URL which points directly to the storage source. This is only functional with Amazon® S3 and/or CloudFront integrations. If you create a URL that points directly to the storage source *( i.e. points directly to Amazon® S3 or CloudFront )*, s2Member will NOT be able to further authenticate the current User/Member; and, s2Member will NOT be able to count the File Download against the current User's account record, because the URL being generated does not pass back through s2Member at all, it points directly to the storage source. For this reason, if you set ``"url_to_storage_source" => true``, you should also set ``"check_user" => true`` and ``"count_against_user" => true``, telling s2Member to authenticate the current User, and if authenticated, count this File Download URL against the current User's account record in real-time *( i.e. as the URL is being generated )*, while it still has a chance to do so. This is useful when you stream files over the RTMP protocol; where an `http://` URL is not feasible. It also helps in situations where a 3rd-party software application will not work as intended, with s2Member's internal redirection to Amazon® S3/CloudFront files. Important, when ``"check_user" => true`` and/or ``"count_against_user" => true``, this API Function will return `false` in situations where the current User/Member does NOT have access to the file.
* 	o ``"count_against_user" => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, it will automatically force ``"check_user" => true`` as well. In other words, s2Member will authenticate the current User, and if authenticated, count this File Download URL against the current User's account record in real-time *( i.e. as the URL is being generated )*. This is off by default. By default, s2Member will simply generate a File Download URL, and upon a User/Member clicking the URL, s2Member will authenticate the User/Member at that time, count the File Download against their account record, and serve the File Download. In other words, under normal circumstances, there is no reason to set ``"check_user" => true`` and/or ``"count_against_user" => true`` when generating the URL itself. However, this is a useful config option when ``"url_to_storage_source" => true``. Please note, when ``"check_user" => true`` and/or ``"count_against_user" => true``, this API Function will return `false` in situations where the current User/Member does NOT have access to the file.
* 	o ``"check_user => false`` Defaults to `false`. If `true`, s2Member will authenticate the current User before allowing the File Download URL to be generated. This is off by default. By default, s2Member will simply generate a File Download URL, and upon a User/Member clicking the URL, s2Member will authenticate the User/Member at that time, and serve the File Download to the User/Member. In other words, under normal circumstances, there is no reason to set ``"check_user" => true`` and/or ``"count_against_user" => true`` when generating the URL itself. However, this IS a useful config option when ``"url_to_storage_source" => true``. Please note, when ``"check_user" => true`` and/or ``"count_against_user" => true``, this API Function will return `false` in situations where the current User/Member does NOT have access to the file.
*
* **Parameter $get_streamer_array ( bool Optional ).** Defaults to `false`. If `true`, this API Function will return an array with the following elements: `streamer`, `file`, `url`. For further details, please review this section in your Dashboard: `s2Member -> Download Options -> JW Player® & RTMP Protocol Examples`. Note, if this is true, s2Member will automatically force ``"url_to_storage_source" => true`` and ``"file_stream" => true``. For that reason, you should carefully review the details and warning above regarding `url_to_storage_source`. If you set ``$get_streamer_array``, you should also set ``"check_user" => true`` and ``"count_against_user" => true``.

* as detected by s2Member. This makes it possible for you to create links on your site, which provide access to protected File Downloads;
* without having to worry about one visitor sharing their link with another.
*
* When `/?s2member_file_download_key` = `a valid Key` generated by this function, it works independently from Member Level Access.
* That is, a visitor does NOT have to be logged in to receive access; they just need a valid Key.
* Using this advanced technique, you could extend s2Member's file protection routines,
* or even combine them with Specific Post/Page Access, and more.
* The possibilities are limitless really.

* 	the resulting Key will be universal *( i.e. valid for any User, at any time, from any browser )*. That is to say; universal, for this particular File.
* 	It is also possible to pass in the ``$directive`` string `ip-forever`, making the Key last forever, but only for a specific IP address.
* @return str The File Download Key. Which is an MD5 hash *( always 32 characters )*, URL-safe.
