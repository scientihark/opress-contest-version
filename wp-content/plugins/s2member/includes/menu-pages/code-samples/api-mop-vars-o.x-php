Here is a breakdown on each of these Variables:

	* `s2member_seeking` = [post|page|catg|ptag]-[ID number] ( Post ID, Page ID, Category ID, Tag ID )
		Or: `s2member_seeking` = ruri-[base64 encoded URI] ( only applies w/ Membership URI Restrictions )
		Or: `s2member_seeking` = file-[protected file name] ( only applies w/ Download Restrictions )
		Or: `s2member_seeking` = bbpress ( only applies when the s2Member -> bbPress Bridge is installed )
	* `s2member_level_req` = a Membership Level # required for access ( only applies to Membership Level Access )
	* `s2member_ccap_req` = a Custom Capability required for access ( only applies to Custom Capability Restrictions )
	* `s2member_sp_req` = a Specific Post/Page ID required ( only applies to Specific Post/Page Access Restrictions )

	`s2member_seeking` is always passed in; it is never excluded.
	`s2member_level_req`, `s2member_ccap_req`, `s2member_sp_req` are mutually exclusive. 
	 Only ONE of these three Variables will be passed in combination with `s2member_seeking`.
