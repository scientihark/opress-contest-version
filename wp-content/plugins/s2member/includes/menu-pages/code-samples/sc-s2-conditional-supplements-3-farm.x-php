[s2If current_user_cannot(access_s2member_level4) AND current_user_can(access_s2member_level2)]

	This Member CANNOT access Level #4,
		but, they CAN access Level #2.

	[_s2If current_user_can(access_s2member_level3)]
		
		Notice that NESTED Conditionals require a preceding underscore ( i.e. _s2If, __s2If, ___s2If ).
			You can go up to three levels deep ( ___s2If ).
				
					Nested PayPal Form/Button Shortcodes ARE fine too.
					However, you do NOT need a preceding underscore on Form/Button codes. Or any other Shortcode for that matter.
					You ONLY need the preceding underscore on _s2If Conditionals that are being nested into each other.
					
					( Hi [s2Get constant="S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_DISPLAY_NAME" /], upgrade now to Level #4! )
					[s2Member-PayPal-Button level="4" ra="49.95" ... /]
						~ see, this will work just fine.
