You\'ll find additional layers of automation available through the use of the `Signup`, `Registration`, `Payment`, `Modification`, `EOT/Deletion`, `Refund/Reversal`, and `Specific Post/Page` Notifications that are available to you through the s2Member API. The s2Member API Notifications make it possible to integrate with 3rd party applications; like list servers, affiliate programs, and other back-office routines; in more advanced ways. Since s2Member API Notifications operate silently on the back-end, they tend to be more reliable and also more versatile. That being said, nothing replaces the simplicity of Tracking Codes. The more advanced API Notifications are NOT always the best tool for the job. For instance, API Notifications will NOT work with Google® Analytics, or 1 pixel &lt;img&gt; tags. They operate silently behind-the-scene, using HTTP connections, as opposed to being loaded in a browser.</p>' . "\n";
