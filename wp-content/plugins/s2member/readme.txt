The s2Member® Framework (free) integrates with PayPal® Website Payments Standard (also free), and fully supports recurring billing. s2Member supports custom Pages for registration (including Custom Registration/Profile Fields), account access, and a lot more. s2Member is compatible with Multisite Networking too, and even with BuddyPress and bbPress. With the s2Member® Pro add-on (an optional paid upgrade), you can add support for unlimited Membership Levels, PayPal® Website Payments Pro (w/ Pro Forms to facilitate on-site credit card processing), Authorize.Net® (also with Pro Forms), Google® Checkout, ClickBank®, advanced User Import/Export tools, the ability to use Coupon Codes, and many other enhancements. Videos available at: [s2Member.com / Videos](http://www.s2member.com/videos/).

s2Member supports Free Subscribers (at Level #0), and up to four primary Membership Levels [1-4] (unlimited with s2Member® Pro). You can label your Membership Levels anything you like. The defaults are Free, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. s2Member also supports an unlimited number of Custom Capability Packages. Custom Capabilities are an easy way to extend s2Member in creative ways. Custom Capabilities allow you to create an unlimited number of Membership Packages, all with different Capabilities and prices.

s2Member allows you to protect Pages, Posts, Tags, Categories, URIs, URI word fragments, URI Replacement Codes for BuddyPress, Specific Post/Page "Buy Now" Access, and even portions of content within Posts/Pages/themes/plugins. All settings are configurable through the s2Member Options panel. This makes s2Member VERY easy to integrate into any site powered by WordPress®. With s2Member, you can also protect downloadable files, using restrictions to control how many downloads can occur within a certain amount of time; all based on Membership Level or even Custom Capabilities. sMember® can even integrate with Amazon® S3 and CloudFront (optional) for serving protected audio/video streams over an RTMP protocol.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= v120309 =
Upgrade immediately.

== Changelog ==

= v120309 =
* (s2Member Pro) **ccBill® Cancellations**. It's now possible for s2Member to pull ccBill® "cancellation" events, from the ccBill® DataLink Service Suite. For further details and configuration options, please check this section of your Dashboard: `s2Member -> ccBill Options -> DataLink Integration`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Some PHP installations running in safe mode were experiencing `400 Bad Request` errors whenever s2Member's Amazon® CloudFront configuration routines for file downloads were processed. Fixed in this release.

= v120308 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Custom Registration/Profile Fields**. Now possible to create a Custom Field that's always hidden, during both registration and any future Profile edits (e.g. for administrative purposes only).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Minor updates for compatibility with the coming release of WordPress® v3.4.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Broken link in UI leading to: `s2m-pro-extras.zip`. Corrected in this release.

= v120301 =
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank**. Bug fix in call to `http_build_query()` related to `arg_separator`. This affected installations of PHP with something other than a default INI value for argument separators. Fixed in this release for better compatibility.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **File downloads**. Bug fix in s2Member's handling of the `"file_storage"` parameter to API Function `s2member_file_download_url()`. Fixed in this release.

= v120219 =
* (s2Member) **File downloads**. s2Member's `.htaccess` rules updated to also support older versions of the Apache 1.x series. However, we still recommend that you run s2Member® with Apache 2.0 or higher. Or, with another modern web server that's Apache-compatible, such as [LiteSpeed](http://litespeedtech.com/).
* (s2Member) **Link updates**. Some of the documentation built into the s2Member® plugin contained links which were outdated after our recent move to the new [s2Member.com](http://www.s2member.com/). These links have now been updated within the plugin.
* (s2Member) **New video tutorial**. [s2Member® Intros, Framework and Pro](http://www.s2member.com/videos/85E41C40550808C2/)
* (s2Member) **New video tutorial**. [s2Member® File Downloads, Complete Series / From Basics On Up](http://www.s2member.com/videos/7547A199A4385310/)
* (s2Member) **New video tutorial**. [s2Member® File Downloads, Amazon S3/CloudFront/JW Player](http://www.s2member.com/videos/BD496E5F2CCAB12A/)

* (s2Member) **New video tutorial**. [s2Member®, Using The PayPal Sandbox](http://www.s2member.com/videos/A7AEF89D281A75A0/)

= v120213 =
* (s2Member) **File downloads**. GZIP conflicts can now been resolved for file downloads. s2Member now introduces an `.htaccess` rewrite rule, which is automatically installed during activation and/or a future upgrade of the s2Member® Framework plugin. These rewrite rules are installed into your root `.htaccess` file for WordPress (if it's writable). If your `.htaccess` file is not writable, you will get a warning in your `s2Member -> Download Options` panel.

 For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Preventing GZIP Conflicts`. Or see [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/resolving-problems-with-file-downloads/).
* (s2Member) **Optimization**. Slow query w/ memory issues during activation on a Multisite Network with over 30K Users/Members. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. Litespeed web server compatibility added to all areas of s2Member. A few `mod_rewrite` tweaks were needed. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. Automatic list transitioning issue, which was affected by Payment Button integrations where s2Member's Auto-Return handler was getting in the way. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix.** Due to an issue that once existed in releases of s2Member prior to v110927, s2Member's Auto EOT System was sometimes failing to succeed in cases where no IPN Signup Vars could be found (but only for Members who originally joined under a release of s2Member prior to v110927). s2Member v120213 resolves this elusive bug with a built-in workaround (i.e. a built-in default value in the code), specifically for this scenario.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix.** If Membership Levels were changed with s2Member Pro via `/wp-config.php` using `define("MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS", 1)` or similar; s2Member was failing to cleanup all unused Capabilities in the `wp_user_roles` array, which may have been associated with previously used Membership Levels. This had no harmful side effects, but it was a bug nevertheless. Upgrading to the latest installation of s2Member automatically cleans up any Capabilities this bug left behind. New installations of s2Member will not be affected by this at all.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance.** Overall review of the codebase, security review, general code cleanup and maintenance.
* (s2Member) **New website.** A new website has been launched for s2Member. Please see: [s2Member.com](http://www.s2member.com/)
* **Coming soon.** Work continues on the next generation of s2Member®.

= v111220 =
* (s2Member Pro) **Security fix**. PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® Forms were vulnerable to an XSS attack, reproducible with a Coupon Code containing special characters. Discovered by ControlScan™. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16173#p56982).
* (s2Member Pro) **Security hardening**. s2Member's Systematics routine hardended against a possible attack coming from a spoofed IP address matching that of the installation server itself. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16412&p=57044#p57044).
* (s2Member Pro) **Security hardening**. PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® Forms hardended against a possible attack against card types. Discovered by ControlScan™. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16173#p56982).

= v111216 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. ClickBank® not passing all s2 Vars after return from a non-recurring transaction. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=16256#p56649).
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. Amazon® S3/CloudFront issues with ACLs upon auto-configuration routine. Leading to a 400 error code. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15853&p=56158#p56159).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WordPress® v3.3 / v3.4**. Updates for compatibility with WordPress® v3.3, and initial compatibility scans against WordPress® v3.4-alpha. Everything looks good. This release of s2Member also remains compatible with the WordPress® v3.2.x series.

= v111206 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WordPress® v3.3**. Updates for compatibility with WordPress® v3.3. This release of s2Member also remains compatible with the WordPress® v3.2.x series.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. An important bug was identified in s2Member's handling of certain EOT events associated with Subscr. Modifications *( under the right scenario )*. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **reCAPTCHA™ bug fix**. An issue with reCAPTCHA™ public/private keys, on s2Member Pro Forms *( particularly on Free Registration Forms )*, which was related to some data loss suffered by Google's reCAPTCHA™ service; has been resolved in this release. In addition, a new UI panel has been introduced, allowing site owners to use their own public/private keys associated with reCAPTCHA™; if they so choose. This is optional however. For further details, please check your Dashboard here: `s2Member -> General Options -> CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Security`. Requires s2Member® Pro.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security hardening**. Additional security checksums have been added to s2Member's utility encryption methods to make these routines even more secure.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security hardening**. Additional security protocols have been added to s2Member's core PayPal® processors to make these routines even more secure.
* (s2Member Pro) **Deprecated feature**. For s2Member Pro Forms with Custom Return URLs on success, the `%%response%%` Replacement Code within URLs is now deprecated, in favor of the new `%%s_response%%`. For further details, please check your Dashboard here: `s2Member -> PayPal/Authorize.Net Pro Forms -> Custom Return URLs On Success -> Replacement Codes`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security fix**. A security vulnerability related to unsigned URLs leading to checkout pages for ccBill®, ClickBank® and Google® Checkout, has been addressed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15232&p=41707#p41707).

= v111105 =
* (s2Member Pro) **New feature**. It is now possible to configure Coupon Codes that are ONLY valid on specific Pages/Posts which may hold one of your s2Member Pro Forms. For further details, please check the examples in your Dashboard, here: `s2Member -> Pro Coupon Codes`.
* (s2Member Pro) **New feature**. Affiliate Coupon Codes make it possible for your affiliates to receive credit for sales they refer, using one of your Coupon Codes. Here's how it works. You tell your affiliates about one or more of the Coupon Codes that you accept. Each of your affiliates can add their affiliate ID onto the end of any valid Coupon Code, like this: `COUPON-CODE-A:123`; where `COUPON-CODE` is the valid Coupon Code that you've configured, and `123` is the affiliate's ID. If a Customer comes to your site, and they use a Coupon Code with an affiliate ID on the end of it; your affiliate will be tracked automatically by s2Member. If this Customer actually completes the sale, the referring affiliate will be credited with whatever commission your affiliate program offers. For further details, please check the examples in your Dashboard, here: `s2Member -> Pro Coupon Codes -> Affiliate Coupon Codes`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **New feature**. It is now possible to protect `all` Posts, but only of a specific Post Type. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Restriction Options -> Post Level Access Restrictions`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Improvement**. The s2Member Pro Login Widget now has improved handling of its `%%previous%%` Replacement Code for login redirections. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15522&p=48448#p48515).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **MOP Vars improved**. s2Member MOP Vars ( Membership Options Page Variables ), have been improved in this release. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API / Scripting -> Membership Options Page (Variables)`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **bbPress®**. Dropped legacy support for bbPress® stand-alone version. s2Member still supports the WordPress® plugin version of bbPress® v2.0+. However, from this version forward, we will no longer support the legacy s2Member Bridge to the stand-alone version of bbPress®. If you've already installed the s2Member Bridge for the stand-alone version of bbPress®, using a previous release of s2Member, your s2Member Bridge plugin should continue to work. However, the s2Member bbPress® Bridge is no longer included with s2Member, and we will not support the stand-alone version of bbPress® from this point forward.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. s2Member function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_gets::get_all_post_ids()` was not properly excluding Post Type `nav_menu_item`. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. s2Member function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_gets::get_all_child_category_ids()` was not including empty terms. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. s2Member function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_gets::get_all_tag_ids()` was not including empty terms. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WordPress® 3.3-beta2**. Compatibility updates for the coming release of WordPress® 3.3.

= v111029 =
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. s2Member Pro now supports automatic upgrades through filesystem methdologies, other than `direct`. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15283#p49034).
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. A bug in the s2Member framework was causing some IPNs with `txn_type = recurring_payment_suspended_due_to_max_failed_payment` to get bypassed inadvertently. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6204&p=48246#p48361).
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug in s2Member Pro's AliPay® integration was causing an error `could not find existing User ID`. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15569&p=49044#p48604).
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug in s2Member Pro's AliPay® integration was causing issues in duplicate IPNs received from AliPay®. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. File Downloads. s2Member now considers server software environments before chunking file downloads, avoiding issues with partially corrupted files on some hosting platforms. In addition, s2Member is now capable of falling back on a flushed delivery method so it can continue to avoid memory issues on shared hosting accounts, even when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is not possible. These improvements allow s2Member to remain compatible in edge cases. Such as when running on Litespeed and/or Windows servers; or on shared hosting platforms that have fewer resources available.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Automatic upgrader failing on `copy` command when running at HostGator. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security fix**. The `/s2member-files/` directory *(with newly updated Mod Rewrite rules in its .htaccess file)* was allowing directory indexing inadvertently, on some servers. This was a low-level vulnerability, because although directory indexing was possible, protected file access was not. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15665&p=48984&hilit=next+release#p48984).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug related to the `init()` Hook firing an early call to `c_ws_plugin__s2member_systematics::is_wp_systematic_use_page()` was identified. Fixed in this release. One symptom of this bug was for Users/Members to have trouble accessing a BuddyPress registration form after having paid for Membership, under the right scenario.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **New API Functions**. New API Functions: `s2member_shorten_url()`, `s2member_user_downloads()`, `s2member_total_downloads_of()`, and `s2member_total_unique_downloads_of()`. For further details, please check the [s2Member Codex](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-summary/).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WordPress® 3.3-beta2**. Compatibility updates. CSS tweaks, JavaScript tweaks and other considerations for the coming release of WordPress® 3.3.

= v111017 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. s2Member now works around a known bug in PHP, related to the `parse_url()` function. For further details, please see [this PHP bug report](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38143).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Improvements to s2Member's `wp_mail()` conformity, related to the reducton of `"Name" <email>` to just `email`. This release should work to further improve email deliverability in edge cases, particulary on sites running an SMTP mail plugin.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Improvements to s2Member's JW Player® integration. s2Member now prevents `unreserved chars`, i.e. `array ("-", ".", "_", "~")` from being URL-encoded in file download URLs, maximizing compatibility with many media players, including JW Player®. In previous releases, JW Player® would randomly fail on some RTMP streams with error `Stream Not Found`. Fixed in this release. For further details, see [RFC 3896](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3986.html).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Initial testing against WordPress v3.3-beta1. Looks pretty good. A few minor cosmetic issues still need to be addressed in a future release of s2Member though.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Tested against BuddyPress v1.5.1. Updated s2Member to support `$bp->maintenance_mode`, and other cases where `bp_core_loaded` is NOT fired at all.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Edge case identified where the `/s2member-o.php` file was failing to fallback on full WordPress®. Fixed in this release.

= v111011 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. An array to string conversion error was found in Profile editing panels whenever a multi-option Select Menu was created as a Custom Registration/Profile Field with s2Member. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15416&p=44801#p45169).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Email recipients / compatibility fix**. A bug found by an s2Member Pro customer, related to PHP's `mail()` function in PHP 5.2 < 5.2.11 was preventing some email messages from being processed properly. Fixed in this release. For further details, see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=14957#p45222) and/or [this PHP bug report](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=28038) please.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. s2Member was redirecting logged-in Users/Members to the Download Limit Exceeded Page whenever an attempt to download a file was made by a User/Member with access at a Level that was NOT allowed to access files period. s2Member should have been redirecting these specific requests to the Membership Options Page instead, with MOP Vars included. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15367#p45122).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Documentation updates**. s2Member's built-in Dashboard documentation has been updated in several places. This should work to further help site owners that are new to s2Member. In addition, s2Member's inline documentation now includes tips for integrating BuddyPress, when/if BuddyPress is installed and activated in your WordPress® installation.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging**. s2Member now adds the currently installed version of PHP to its log entries, if logging is enabled by the site owner.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **AWeber**. A bug was found in s2Member's AWeber integration. When/if you configured s2Member NOT to collect First/Last Names, the email subscription request was not being parsed properly on the AWeber side of things, due to a regex issue in their built-in PayPal Email Parser. Fixed in this release. In addition, s2Member has built a Custom Email Parser for AWeber, which is optional, but definitely recommended. Please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=15496) for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug was found in s2Member's email configuration routine, which made it possible *( based on other plugin combinations running in concert with s2Member )*, for s2Member to drop existing `mail_from` values configured by other plugins, which may have resulted in delivery failures, particularly when/if a site was configured to use an external SMTP server, which MAY require that your `From:` header reference a specific address, one that is directly associated with your external SMTP account. Fixed in this release. In addition, please be advised that if you run an SMTP mail plugin with WordPress®, you should be sure to configure your `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration` with a valid `From:` address *( i.e. one matching your SMTP configuration perhaps )*. Most free SMTP servers, such as Gmail/Yahoo, require that your `From:` header match the email address associated with your account. Please check with your SMTP service provider before attempting to configure plugins like s2Member to use a different `From:` address when sending email messages. For further details, please check your Dashboad, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **MailChimp®/AWeber® list transitioning**. s2Member's list transitioning routine ( an optional feature ) has been further optimized and improved. In addition, it is now possible to force the transition of Users/Members from one set of lists to another, even when s2Member is unable to remove them from an existing list. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API List Servers -> Automate Unsubscribe / Opt-Outs`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Reset or lock-in Roles/Capabilities**. A new development tool is available in your Dashboard, which makes it possible for developers to reset and/or lock-in the Roles/Capabilities associated with s2Member. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Membership Levels/Labels`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.

= v111003 =
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. Fatal `eval()` error inside: `/includes/classes/no-cache.inc.php`. Fixed in this release.

= v111002 =
* (s2Member) **BuddyPress v1.5 fix**. Issues with BuddyPress v1.5 and s2Member's URI Restrictions; corrected in this release. Hook priority updated, and `template_redirect` converted to `wp` at priority `2`, giving s2Member the ability to integrate with BuddyPress v1.5 properly in all scenarios.
* (s2Member) **tinyURL® bug fix**. s2Member's handling of potential failures in the output of tinyURLs, generated by the tinyURL® API; was NOT considering all failure possibilities. A symptom of this bug was to see URLs in your Signup Confirmation Email (occassionally, upon connection failure to the tinyURL® API, when it was down for whatever reason) starting with: `Error#`. Corrected in this release.
* (s2Member) **URL Shortening API (Preference)**. s2Member now includes a class method dedicated to URL shortening service APIs. Currently, s2Member will use the tinyURL® API first *(i.e. tinyurl.com )*, and then use the Google® URL Shortening API *(i.e. goo.gl )* as a backup when/if the tinyURL® API is down for whatever reason. In this release, a new configurable option is available, which allows advanced site owners to preference the Google® Shortening API over tinyURL®, if they desire. It is also possible to integrate your own custom GET request, for whichever service you prefer. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> URL Shortening API (Preference)`.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. Bug first introduced in s2Member v110912. s2Member's new optimized method of loading its CSS/JS was causing some problems on a few Windows® server environments. In some cases, s2Member was unable to properly identify itself through the `/s2member-o.php` file, given limitations of the core WordPress® function `plugin_basename()`. A symptom of this bug was for s2Member to fail at loading its CSS/JS libraries. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Security fix**. It was possible for some of s2Member's code sample files to be executed directly. Not a proven vulnerability, but definitely NOT a good idea to allow this either. Fixed in this release, by renaming all `.php` files inside the `/includes/menu-pages/code-samples/` directory. These files now have a `.x-php` extension. As an additional line of defense, a new `.htaccess` file with `deny from all` is automatically placed inside the main `/s2member/includes/` directory. None of these files should be available pulicly anyway. s2Member's exsiting `realpath()` file scans remain in place too, which further prevents the direct execution of `.php` files.

= v110927 =
* (s2Member) **BuddyPress v1.5 compatibility**. Misc tweaks.
* (s2Member) **Documentation improvements**. New documentation covering Shortcode Attributes and API Function parameters for the new `[s2File /]` Shortcode, and for the new API Function `s2member_file_download_url()`. Please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Shortcode Attributes / API Functions ( Explained )`.

= v110926 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **BuddyPress v1.5**. Updated for compatibility with BuddyPress v1.5.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member Pro v110912 was causing problems for Pro Forms integrated on a Child Blog of Multisite Blog Farm. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Custom Registration/Profile Fields configured to require an EXACT number of characters and/or digits was NOT being handled properly by s2Member in all cases. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member v110912 was causing problems with s2Member's default email customization templates. Double percent signs `%%` for Replacement Codes were being reduced by s2Member's internationalization routines, to just single percent signs `%`, thereby nullifying them as valid Replacement Codes. Fixed in this release. If you installed s2Member and/or s2Member Pro v110912 - v110915 on a clean installation of WordPress®, it would be a good idea to have a quick look at your email customizations with s2Member, just to make sure your Replacement Codes have double percent signs around them *( for example, this is valid: `%%registration_url%%`, and this is NOT valid: `%registration_url%` )*.
* (s2Member) **Amazon® S3/CloudFront**. s2Member is now fully integrated with Amazon® CloudFront, in addition to its existing support for Amazon® S3. Please note, one of the greatest things about Amazon® CloudFront, is its ability to `stream/seek` media files in the truest sense of the word over the RTMP protocol. For sites delivering protected `FLV/MP4/OGG/WEBM` and other streaming audio/video file types over the RTMP protocol, Amazon® CloudFront is our recommendation. Once you've successfully configured s2Member to use both Amazon® S3 and Amazon® CloudFront together, please review this section in your Dashboard: `s2Member -> Download Options -> JW Player® & RTMP Protocol Examples`. s2Member will automatically serve your protected files over the RTMP protocol, using an Amazon® CloudFront Streaming Distribution. In fact, s2Member can even configure all of your Amazon® S3/CloudFront Distros, ACLs, and Policies automatically; making it possible for just about anyone to stream media s2Member-protected files in real-time.
* (s2Member) **s2File Shortcode**. s2Member now provides a new Shortcode: `[s2File /]`. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Basic Download Restrictions`.

= v110915 =
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member/s2Member Pro v110912+ was causing parse errors on Authorize.Net Free Regisration Forms. Fixed in this release.

= v110913 =
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. s2Member v110912+ requires WordPress® v3.2+.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member v110912 related to JavaScript/CSS files not loading properly on some installations has been corrected in this release. One symptom of this bug was s2Member's failure to display Pro Form integrations properly in some cases. Another symptom may have been improper handling of Registration Form validations.
* (s2Member) **HostGator**. Tildas ( `~` ) found in some encrypted data strings were triggering `mod_security` conflicts on sites powered by HostGator. This release corrects the problem on HostGator by stripping tildas from query strings processed by s2Member. In addition, HostGator has been very helpful in white-listing the s2Member application across its entire network to prevent interruption of service. For further details, please check [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=14787#p35909).

= v110912 =
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. This version of s2Member requires WordPress® v3.2+.
* (s2Member) **Alternative View Protections**. s2Member's Alternative View Protections are now more flexible, allowing specific types of Protections to be applied individually now, instead of in groups. In addition, there are two new types of Alternative View Protection available: Comment Feeds (new), and WordPress® Navigation Menus (new). For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Restriction Options -> Alternative View Protections`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Independent Custom Capabilities**. The integration of Independent Custom Capabilities from the last release, has now been completed for all of s2Member's Payment Gateways. In this release, we completed Independent Custom Capability integration for ClickBank®, Google® Checkout, ccBill®, and AliPay®. Independent Custom Capabilities are already possible with PayPal®, PayPal® Pro, and Authorize.Net®, from the last release. Further improvements to this aspect of s2Member Pro will come in a future release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security**. Back-end panels for both s2Member and s2Member Pro have been updated to use `password` input fields, anywhere/everywhere sensitive data is being configured. This helps to further safeguard various API and Payment Gateway credentials on your installation of WordPress®. In other words, some sensitive data that you configure for s2Member, will now appear with just x's `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, instead of the actual data that you entered; *( e.g. `password` input fields secure this information from prying eyes )*.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Translation Support**. s2Member and s2Member Pro are now equipped with support for front-end translation, using standardized WordPress® methodologies; i.e. we've implemented the use of `_x()`, and various other translation routines for many aspects of s2Member's front-end interfaces. For instance, things like Profile panels, Login/Registration Fields, and Pro Form integrations; as well as error messages displayed to Users/Members. Translation support for back-end admin panels provided by s2Member will come in a future release, along with more extensive translation support for front-end aspects.
 
 Please note, this is but our first step toward internationalizing s2Member and s2Member Pro. Look for further updates/improvements to come in the future.
 
 Like WordPress® itself, we chose to use the GNU `gettext` localization framework to provide localization infrastructure for s2Member®. GNU `gettext` is a mature, widely used framework for modular translation of software, and is the *de facto* standard for localization in the open source/free software realm. If you'd like to translate s2Member and/or s2Member Pro, please use the POT file found inside `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot`, which contains all translation entries for both the s2Member Framework *( i.e. the free version )*, and also for s2Member Pro.
 
 The file: `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot` will be updated with each new release of s2Member.
 If this is your first translation of a WordPress® plugin, [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Localization_Technology) and/or [this article](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/), might be of some assistance. When you are finished translating the `s2member.pot` file, place your completed `s2member-[locale].mo` file into this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/`; and please feel free to [share your translation](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4) with the rest of the s2Member® community.
 
 Quick Tip: If you only need to translate the front-end of s2Member, please ignore entries in the `s2member.pot` file with a context matching `s2member-admin`. Those sections of s2Member are only seen by site Administrators; they are NOT used in s2Member's front-end integration with WordPress®. Skipping over translation entries with a context matching `s2member-admin` can save you time.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix / Multisite**. A bug fix related to site creation within the Dashboard on a Multisite Blog Farm, has been corrected in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=10307#p32628).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. New Filter added to s2Member's source code, allowing s2Member Pro site owners to enable/disable tab indexing of reCAPTCHA box controllers *( e.g. the three mundane buttons )* that are skipped over 99.9% of the time anyway. If you'd like to enable tab indexing on these buttons, use: `add_filter("c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_tabindex_recaptcha_icons", "__return_true");` inside a `/wp-content/mu-plugins/s2-hacks.php` file.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Some site owners running s2Member Pro, on server configurations with PHP-based output compression enabled, experienced problems with the `success=""` Shortcode Attribute for s2Member Pro Forms. s2Member Pro has been improved in this regard *( i.e. s2Member Pro now makes better attempts to clear output buffers before returning plain text data with it's handlers )*. In addition, calls to `trim()` have also been implemented as an additional line of defense against errors reported in the previous release; which were related to URLs with leading white space, returned by s2Member's core PayPal® IPN processor.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Conformity**. s2Member and s2Member Pro now make use of a core WordPress® function for all HTTP status headers ( i.e. `status_header(xxx)` ).
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Forms / Tabindex ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro Forms suffered from a bug related to `tabindex` conflicts whenever MANY Custom Registration/Profile Fields were configured together. Corrected in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **Google® Checkout ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro's integration with Google Checkout has been updated in this release to use `display-disposition: PESSIMISTIC` instead of `OPTIMISTIC`. This change prevents possible card declines from slipping through, and thereby granting a Customer access inadvertently. With the former `OPTIMISTIC` behavior, in rare cases when payment authorizaton at Google® Checkout took longer than 20 seconds, s2Member was giving a Customer access to the site, instead of waiting pessimistically for Google® Checkout to complete processing. The updated behavior, now set to `PESSIMISTIC`, prevents this from occurring. For technical details, see [this article](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/Google_Checkout_Digital_Delivery.html).
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank® ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro's integration with ClickBank® has been updated in this release. A bug was found by WebSharks, Inc. Support Rep: Cristián Lávaque, related to the verification of POST vars. Whenever UTF-8 characters appeared in any part of a ClickBank® IPN response received by s2Member, s2Member was failing to verify the checksum, and thus, returning the error: `POST vars could not be verified`. This issue has been corrected in the latest release of s2Member Pro. In addition, a known bug with ClickBank® cutting off first/last names whenever special characters were part of either name, has now been side-stepped by s2Member Pro's integration with ClickBank®.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal® ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro's integration with the PayPal® Pro API has been updated in this release. A bug was found by the s2Member community which affected a rare scenario during heavy testing. When/if a site owner was heavily testing s2Member Pro Forms repeatedly, whereby PayPal® Pro Recurring Profiles were created over and over again; one of these Recurring Profiles could still be in a `Pending` state during a Subscription Modification soon thereafter. This is rare, because Recurring Profiles are usually in a `Pending` state on the PayPal® side of things, for just a few seconds. However, in this test case, it was possible for s2Member to create a second Recurring Profile through the PayPal® Pro API, and the old one would NOT be terminated properly, because it was still in a `Pending` state, and unable to be terminated. This release of s2Member Pro resolves this issue and prevents this from occuring under any scenario. Customers and/or site owners testing s2Member Pro Forms will now see an error message related to pending changes, and the Customer would be asked to wait 15 minutes in this rare scenario.
* (s2Member) **Protected Files**. This version of s2Member updates the `.htaccess` file in your `/s2member-files/` directory with `mod_rewrite` rules which provide additional flexibility in the way protected files are served to your Customers. With the new `mod_rewrite` rules, it is now possible to link directly to a protected file, avoiding the use of query string variables *( it's completely optional though )*.

 In other words, this update adds new functionality, it does NOT change anything that already existed. This new flexibility may come in handy for site owners serving files through media playback devices that have issues with query string variables. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced Mod Rewrite Linkage`.
 
 Dev note. Any existing `.htaccess` file inside your `/s2member-files/` directory will be overwritten by this release, as it should be. However, if you'd like s2Member to preserve a custom `.htaccess` file that you've written, please create this directory and file: `/wp-content/mu-plugins/s2-hacks.php`, and put this inside it: `<?php add_filter("ws_plugin__s2member_preserve_files_dir_htaccess", "__return_true"); ?>`. Please do this before you upgrade, if this is your intention.
* (s2Member) **Download Keys**. There is now a Shortcode equivalent to s2Member's API function `s2member_file_download_key($file, $directive)`. You can now do this in this WordPress® Visual Editor if you prefer: `[s2Key file_download="example-file.zip" /]` without needing a PHP Execution plugin.

 For those of you that use the optional `$directive` parameter, you can do something like this: `[s2Key file_download="example-file.zip" directive="ip-forever|universal" /]`. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced Download Restrictions`. Or see [this article](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=12453#src_doc_s2member_file_download_key%28%29) in the s2Member Codex.
* (s2Member) **Localhost Installs**. s2Member now includes information for site owners developing in a `localhost` environment, with WAMP/MAMP or something like EasyPHP. Instructions are now easier to find. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Localhost WAMP/MAMP Developers`.
* (s2Member) **PayPal® ( Bug fix )**. s2Member was incorrectly handling delayed EOT Times under a specific scenario, as [reported here](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=14876&p=34414#p34414). Corrected in this release.
* (s2Member) **JavaScript/CSS Optimization**. s2Member now loads its dynamic JavaScript/CSS libraries through a new optimized file called `/s2member-o.php`, designed to increase the speed at which your installation of WordPress® can load these resources. The new optimized `/s2member-o.php` file loads only the core WordPress® framework and the s2Member JavaScript and/or CSS file, depending on which is being requested. This new file will eliminate a potential bottleneck on some WordPress® installations, which may have MANY other plugins running in concert with s2Member. It also works to further reduce CPU and memory consumption for all site owners. For further details about why this optimization is beneficial, please see [this article](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=14359&p=33441#p33441).
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal® Express Checkout / Pre-Population**. s2Member now pre-populates everything it can through PayPal® Express Checkout integration. If a Customer does NOT already have a PayPal® account when they arrive at Express Checkout, the Account Creation Form at PayPal® will be pre-populated with a minimum of their Name and Email Address. Street address information will ONLY be pre-populated, when/if s2Member collects it for tax purposes. Otherwise, the address information will NOT be pre-populated, because only PayPal® will ask for those details anyway *( i.e. s2Member doesn't ask for address details when Express Checkout is used; not unless you're collecting taxes: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> Tax Calculations` ).
* (s2Member) **New API Function**. This version of s2Member includes a new API Function `get_s2member_custom_fields()`, designed to provide more information about Custom Registration/Profile Field configuration and values for a specific User. The API function `get_user_field()` remains available as well. For further details, please see [this article](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-summary/) in the s2Member Codex.
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Login Widget**. This version of s2Member improves the `%%automatic%%` setting for the Signup URL in Pro Login Widgets. When/if a Customer has already paid for their Membership, the Signup URL presented in the Pro Login Widget will change dynamically, pointing a Customer to the Registration Form, instead of to your Membership Options Page. Of course, this behavior could be overridden by changing the Signup URL to something other than `%%automatic%%`, if you prefer.

= v110815 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Independent Custom Capabilities.** You can now sell one or more Custom Capabilities using Buy Now functionality, to "existing" Users/Members, regardless of which Membership Level they have on your site *( i.e. you could even sell Independent Custom Capabilities to Users at Membership Level #0, normally referred to as Free Subscribers, if you like )*. So this is quite flexible. Independent Custom Capabilities do NOT rely on any specific Membership Level. That's why s2Member refers to these as *Independent* Custom Capabilities, because you can sell Capabilities this way, through Buy Now functionality, and the Customer's Membership Level Access, along with any existing paid Subscription they may already have with you, will remain completely unaffected. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> PayPal® Buttons -> Capability (Buy Now) Buttons`. Independent Custom Capabilities are currently integrated with PayPal® Standard Buttons, PayPal® Pro Forms, and Authorize.Net® Pro Forms only. Integration with other Payment Gateways supported by s2Member Pro will come in a future release.
* (s2Member) **API Tracking.** This release of s2Member introduces two new API Tracking methods, now making it possible to incorporate Tracking Codes *( i.e. affiliate program integrations, as one example )* for `Signup Tracking`, `Modification Tracking (new)`, and also for `Capability Tracking (new)`. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Tracking`. These new methods are ( in addition to ) s2Member's API Notifications, which remain available. s2Member's API Notifications are intended for more advanced tracking integrations, such as a 3rd-party call through an HTTP request.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix / Multisite.** s2Member's supplemental API Functions `current_user_is()`, `current_user_is_not()` and the `..for_blog()` alternatives, were not properly considering Super Administators on a Multisite Network installation. On a Multisite Network, the WordPress `$user->has_cap()` routine returns true for anything passed in on a Super Administrator account, causing s2Member's `user_is` API Functions to return true for Super Administrators in some cases, when it really should NOT have been. Fixed in this release. If you need to use `current_user_is()` against a Super Administrator, the `user_is` API Functions introduced by s2Member will only return true in these special cases: `current_user_is("super_administrator")` and/or `current_user_is("administrator")`. Super Administrators should always have the `administrator` Role, for all Blogs in the Network, and s2Member will also consider the fake Role `super_administrator` *( unique to s2Member )* for cases when you need to test explicity for a Super Administrator. Actually, you could also just use the WordPress core function for this: `is_super_admin()` *( recommended )*.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix / Capabilities.** When/if you require Custom Capabilities in order to view certain content sections on your site, s2Member was behaving properly in all cases, except for one specific scenario. When an Administrator of the site *( on a normal single-site installation of WordPress )*, was attempting to test-view content protected with Custom Capabilities *( this scenario was causing a problem )*. What was happening, is that s2Member was seeing that an Adminstrator did not have certain Custom Capabilities defined explicity in their account, and access was being denied *( that's actually, NOT right )*. This was in conflict with the way that s2Member handles all other content protection routines with respect to Administrators. Administrators should automatically have access to all protected content, even if Custom Capabilities are not explicity defined in their account. After all, they are Administrators. In short, this release makes it possible for Administrators of a single-site WordPress installation, to have full access to all content; even when/if Custom Capabilities are required. This should help to prevent confusion for site owners just beginning to understand s2Member's functionality with respect to Custom Capabilities.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix / Coupon Codes.** s2Member Pro Forms were failing to apply Coupon Codes properly in some cases. Whenever a Coupon Code eliminated all initial charges for a Trial Amount, s2Member was attempting to charge a zero dollar sale amount, under the right scenario. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **API Notifications.** Starting with this release, s2Member's Payment Notifications are also triggered whenever a Buy Now purchase for Independent Custom Capabilities takes place (new). The documentation in your Dashboard has been updated. For further details, please see: `s2Member -> API Notifications -> Payment Notifications`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Cookies.** Both s2Member and s2Member Pro now fully support the `COOKIEPATH`, `SITECOOKIEPATH`, and `COOKIE_DOMAIN` constants from the WordPress® core, making s2Member more secure on Multisite Networks, and improving compatibility overall for sites that use one or more of these PHP Constants in their `/wp-config.php` file.
* (s2Member Pro) **UI Improvement / tabindex.** s2Member Pro Forms have been updated to skip tab indexes on reCAPTCHA box controllers *( e.g. the three mundane buttons )* that are skipped over 99.9% of the time anyway. This allows Pro Form tab controls to jump immediately to the reCAPTCHA input field, if/when enabled by your Shortcode.
* (s2Member Pro) **UI Improvement.** s2Member\'s live feed inside your Dashboard, which is responsible for delivering updates that come from Lead Developer Jason Caldwell and s2Member Support Reps, has been improved in this release. You'll see this on the right-hand side of s2Member's UI panels, near the top.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Capability Additions (Changed).** In previous versions of s2Member, when generating a Payment Button/Form, it was possible to precede your list of Custom Capabilities with a `+` sign, indicating that you wish to (Add) new Custom Capabilities instead of (Resetting) a User's Capbilities to the ones you list. Starting with this release, (Add) is now the default behavior. In other words, the `+` sign is no longer required, because s2Member will automatically (Add) Capabilities to any that already exist for a particular User/Member, even without the `+` sign *(no longer required)*. In addition, there is now a new directive available: `-all`. You may now precede your list of Custom Capabilities with `-all`, but only if you wish to (Remove/Reset) all Custom Capabilities, and then (Add) new ones. For example: `-all,music,videos`, would remove any existing Custom Capabilities that may or may not already exist for a particular User/Member, and then add: `music,videos`. There are additional examples provided by the Payment Button/Form Generators that come with s2Member. Please check your Dashboard if you'd like to learn more.
* (s2Member) **Compatibility.** s2Member's ability to modify the WordPress® Admin Bar for Users/Members has been updated to fully support WordPress® v3.2+. This feature now behaves as expected in the latest release. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Profile Modifications`. The Redirection option in that section, has the side effect of manipulating the Admin Bar across the top of your site *( if enabled )*, making WordPress® behave properly.
* (s2Member Pro) **Options Import/Export.** s2Member Pro now makes it possible to export your s2Member options, in their entirety, and then import them into another instance of WordPress®. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Import/Export`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Memory.** Memory reporting is now added to log entries by s2Member.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **JavaScript.** Minor optimization of s2Member's JavaScript routine.

= v110812 =
* (s2Member) **Security fix.** This release addresses an important security vulnerability in previous releases of the s2Member Framework *( i.e. the free version of s2Member )*. Sites with Download Options configured for s2Member should be advised to update to s2Member v110812+ as soon as possible to avoid possible exploits.

= v110731 =
* **(s2Member) Bug fix / Multisite.** In the Multisite (Config) panel, s2Member was not properly displaying the number of Blogs allowed at Level #0, in some cases.
* **(s2Member Pro) Update / ClickBank®.** s2Member Pro has been updated to better support ClickBank's policy on Thank-You Pages. s2Member now provides a link on the ClickBank Return-Page where Customers may contact your support department, and a message regarding charges on a Customer's bank statement appearing as `CLKBANK*COM`. This is mandatory for all ClickBank® integrations. ClickBank® will not approve your Products without this information on the Thank-You Page integrated with s2Member. In addition, s2Member now makes it possible to customize your Thank-You Page for ClickBank®. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> ClickBank® Options -> Thank-You Page`. If you have attempted to use temporary hacks of your own in order to avoid issues with ClickBank® policy in this regard, we suggest that you remove those hacks, and instead work with the new features introduced in this release of s2Member Pro. If you need assistance, please use the s2Member forums.
* **(s2Member Pro) Pro API For Remote Operations.** With s2Member Pro installed, you now have access to the s2Member Pro API For Remote Operations. This is made available for developers that wish to create User/Member accounts dynamically through custom scripts of their own. s2Member's Remote Operations API requires a secret API Key in order to POST authenticated requests to your installation of s2Member. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Remote Operations API`.
* **(s2Member) Compatibility.** In cases where a site owner integrates Amazon® S3 file storage for protected File Downloads, with an invalid Bucket name which contains mixed caSe ( that's a no-no anyway ), s2Member will now convert the Amazon® S3 connection URL to `s3.amazonaws.com/[BUCKET]`, instead of the default `[bucket].s3.amazonaws.com`. This is required for invalid Bucket names which use mixed caSe. The only way for Amazon® S3 communication to work with these invalid Bucket names, is with a sub-folder URL. See docs on [Bucket names](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?BucketRestrictions.html).
* **(s2Member) Feature Improvement.** s2Member's API Tracking Codes are now displayed immediately after checkout in all possible scenarios. This is an improvement over past versions, where s2Member sometimes had to await IPN processing before Tracking Codes integrated with s2Member could be displayed on-site. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Tracking`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) New Feature / Thank-You Page Templates.** s2Member's Return Page handlers ( aka: Thank-You Page handlers ) have been improved. Instead of using a JavaScript alert immediately after checkout, s2Member now displays all responses with pure HTML. In addition, with s2Member Pro installed ( and only with s2Member Pro installed ), it is now possible to customize the header section ( i.e the top ) of your Thank-You Page from the Dashboard, and/or to create a custom template file inside your active WordPress® theme directory for each Payment Gateway integrated with s2Member ( all optional ). For details on your PayPal Return Page ( aka: Thank-You Page ), please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> PayPal Options -> Auto-Return/PDT Integration -> Auto-Return Page Template`.
 
 The ability to customize the Return Page is now possible ( for all applicable Payment Gateways ) integrated with s2Member Pro, including: PayPal® Standard, ClickBank®, ccBill®, and AliPay®. Other Payment Gateways, such as: PayPal® Pro, Authorize.Net®, and Google® Checkout do NOT require a Return-Page anyway, so they are NOT applicable in this regard.
 
 *Please note, this feature improvement should NOT negatively impact any existing installations of s2Member. In other words, you don't need to change anything in your existing installation, unless you want to. Custom Return Page templates are completely optional. This improvement simply makes new things possible in s2Member Pro, and even provides a smoother experience for all Customers completing checkout through the free version of s2Member. If you need to customize s2Member's default Return-Page Template, please upgrade to s2Member Pro, where the tools for this are made available in your Dashboard.*
* **(s2Member) New Feature / Login Counter.** Starting with this release, s2Member will automatically monitor the number of times each User/Member logs into your site. This information is made visible to the site owner in the list of Users ( i.e. in the Dashboard ). This information is also used as the basis for a new feature in s2Member Pro, which allows for the configuration of One-Time-Offers, based on the number of previous logins at your site. For further details, please check your Dashboard with s2Member Pro installed, see: `s2Member -> General Options -> One-Time-Offers`.
* **(s2Member Pro) Feature Improvement / Success Attribute.** With s2Member Pro installed, it is also possible to completely override the Standard Return-Page handlers with the `success=""` Attribute in your Shortcode. This works with PayPal® Standard integration, and also for AliPay®. New in this release, It is now possible to achieve the same result with ClickBank® and ccBill® too, using the instructions provided in your s2Member options panel, for each respective Gateway. Also, this release of s2Member improves the handling of custom Return URLs.

 In all cases, s2Member will now ALWAYS handle the initial redirection after checkout, where s2Member sets important authorization cookies, and THEN ( if configured to do so ) redirect to your custom URL on success. This prevents issues with registration authorization cookies not being set properly when/if custom Success URLs are used. This was a problematic area in previous releases of s2Member, and this version should resolve those issues; as long as the updated instructions are followed inside your Dashboard. For example, with ClickBank®, please see: `s2Member -> ClickBank® Options -> Thank-You Page -> Thank-You Page Templates` for full details regarding all possible customizations. You will find similar instructions for other Payment Gateways integrated with s2Member.
* **(s2Member Pro) New Feature / One-Time-Offers.** With s2Member Pro installed, it is now possible to configure One-Time-Offers ( Upon Login ). This feature allows site owners to display a different page the 1st time a User/Member logs in ( and more ), and/or to create loyaltly rewards/offers for Users/Members who have been very active on their account. For further details, please check your Dashboard with s2Member Pro installed, see: `s2Member -> General Options -> One-Time-Offers`.
* **(s2Member) Bug fix. BuddyPress Profile Fields.** s2Member's integration with BuddyPress Profile fields was invalid in cases where public Profiles were being viewed/edited while another User was logged in. s2Member was displaying/populating the current User's Custom Field data in places where it should have been pulling details based on `$bp->displayed_user->id`. This bug has been corrected in this release of s2Member.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Code Restructuring / Security Hardening.** s2Member's core IPN and Return-Page handlers have been reorganized into sub-classes containing conditional phases. This made it possibe to harden s2Member's security in various ways, and also sets the groundwork for new features ( coming soon ). One way in which s2Member's security had been hardended in this release, is that it's now harder, if not impossible, for s2Member to reprocess any IPN and/or Return-Page Data in duplicate. In rare cases where information comes through in duplicate, s2Member will ignore dupes completely, recover gracefully, log important details, and/or display `Page Expired` notifications to possible attackers.
* **(s2Member Pro) Bug fix. Authorize.Net® ARB.** s2Member Pro was incorrectly handling scenarios where a Customer was attempting to create an ARB Profile with a credit card that expires before the 2nd payment in the ARB Profile would clear. s2Member Pro always collects the first payment up front, and starts the ARB Profile to handle future payments. In cases where a Customer's card would expire before the second payment is collected, the creation of the ARB Profile would fail on the Authorize.Net® side, and s2Member Pro was not recovering properly. The result is that the Customer was charged for the first payment, and then left with a decline notice on-site ( not good ). In this release, s2Member Pro has been updated to avoid the situation where a Customer may be declined, with the error `The credit card expires before the subscription startDate`. In this scenario, s2Member will now allow the Customer's transaction to go through ( collecting the first payment in real-time ), and allowing the Customer to gain access. In this case, s2Member knows that future payments will fail because the card will expire beforehand, so an EOT Time for the Customer will be set during checkout.

= v110710 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Bug fix.** Some versions of PHP were generating an error `Warning: call_user_func_array()` after registration. This error was caused by a new static class method introduced in s2Member v110708, which was NOT previously declared `static` explicity. This release of s2Member v110710 corrects this bug and eliminates the error message. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* **(s2Member) New Feature.** It is now possible to enable/disable s2Member's customization of New User Email notifications. This may be desirable when/if you're using a plugin ( other than s2Member ) to handle this aspect of your installation. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* **(s2Member) New Feature.** It is now possible to customize both the Username/Password email ( e.g. the email sent to new Users/Members after registration ), and now you can ALSO customize the Administrative "New User Notification" email too. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.

= v110709 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Email Configuration ( bug fix ).** New file `/s2member/includes/functions/pluggables.inc.php` was missing in the last release, weird. This release adds the missing file that implements this new feature included in the previous Changelog. FEATURE: Some new options are now available that allow site owners to customize the email that contains the Username/Password for new Users/Members. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.

= v110708 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Compatibility.** s2Member and s2Member Pro have both been updated to support WordPress® v3.2.
* **(s2Member Pro) Unlimited Membership Levels.** With s2Member Pro installed, you may now configure an unlimited number of Membership Levels. You can set the number of Membership Levels by adding this line to your /wp-config.php file: `define("MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS", 4);`. Feel free to change the default value of 4 to whatever you need. The minimum allowed value is 1. The recommended maximum is 100. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Membership Levels/Labels`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Email Configuration.** Some new options are now available that allow site owners to customize the email that contains the Username/Password for new Users/Members. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Bug fix.** A problem with certain email addresses routed through the `wp_mail()` function, containing special characters in the "Name" portion. The issue was related to the way in which `wp_mail()` handles recipient addresses in the format `"Name" <address>`. s2Member now strips double quotes dynamically ( i.e. internally ), so that `wp_mail()` and the PHPMailer class can deal with this format on their own. This bug fix should also prevent seemingly random `500 Internal Server Error` messages during checkout. One symptom of this bug was to find "Premature end of script headers" inside your Apache error log, followed by an error code of `500` reported in the browser. These issues have been corrected in this release of s2Member.
* **(s2Member) Bug fix.** A bug first introduced in v110604 was preventing s2Member from setting a User's "Display Name" during Registration properly. This bug has been corrected in the latest release. In addition, a new configurable option for this behavior has been added to the s2Member General Options panel. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Registration/Profile Fields -> Display Name`.
* **(s2Member) Bug fix.** A bug first introduced in v110604 was preventing s2Member from handling password strenth meters in the Stand-Alone Profile Editing Panel ( i.e. the popup version ).
* **(s2Member) Documentation.** s2Member's `API Scripting` sections inside your Dashboard have been updated in various places, in support of some new API Functions/Constants introduced in the latest versions of s2Member; and also to reference relevant articles in the [s2Member Codex](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=40).

= v110620 =
* **(s2Member) Bug fix.** s2Member has been updated to support GMT offset in date calculations for Registration Time. In previous versions, this was addressed using `date_i18n()`, but this update now includes the proper function call to `get_date_from_gmt()`. No changes are necessary, as this update simply corrects the way Registration Times are displayed in your list of Users. Starting with v110620, s2Member will now display Registration Times with the correct GMT offset, based on your configuration of `WordPress -> General Options -> Timezone`.

= v110617 =
* **(s2Member) Bug fix.** A bug first introduced in s2Member v110604 has been corrected. This bug was hindering s2Member's ability to identify MIME types for protected File Downloads.
* **(s2Member) HTML 5 MIME types.** s2Member has been updated to provide support through File Download protection for HTML 5 MIME types: `video/ogg` and  `video/webm`.

= v110606 =
* **(s2Member). MailChimp® over SSL.** s2Member has been updated to communicate with the MailChimp® API over SSL, for improved security. No action or reconfiguration is necessary, as this only affects the HTTP protocol used during communication with the MailChimp® API.
* **(s2Member). Documentation update.** s2Member has been updated to mention the PHP Execution plugin, which is required to take full advantage of `"Advanced" Download Restrictions`, through the application of a File Download Key. The creation of a File Download `Key`, requires a small PHP code snippet. In order to use PHP scripting inside your Posts/Pages, you'll need to install this handy plugin ( [PHP Execution](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/php-execution-plugin/) ).
* **(s2Member). MailChimp® data center prefix.** Starting with this release, the data center prefix ( ex: `us1`, etc ), will be recorded in s2Member's log file for MailChimp® communication. The only change here, is the inclusion of the prefix in the log file. s2Member has always used proper data center prefixes, they just weren't included in the log file until now.
* **(s2Member). Amazon® S3 bug fix.** s2Member has been updated to support all regions, and not just the `US Standard`. If you were getting errors in the previous release, related to Amazon® S3 storage locations being accessed inproperly, this release of s2Member v110606 should resolve the issue for you. To put it simply, s2Member now connects to your S3 Bucket using `[bucket].s3.amazonaws.com`, instead of `s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket]`, making s2Member more compatible in this regard; and as suggested by [this documentation](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html). This also improves the User experience, since your Bucket name will appear in the host name of the download, instead of just `s3.amazonaws.com`.

= v110605 =
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** If File Download protection was enabled, changes introduced in the previous release, were causing some site Administrators to receive a "File Download Limit Exceeded" error under the right circumstances. This has been corrected in the release of s2Member v110605.

= v110604 - 1.0 =
* ... trimmed away at v110604.
* Initial release: v1.0.
