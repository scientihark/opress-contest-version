Syntax Highlighter supporting multiple languages, themes, fonts, highlighting from a URL, local file or post text.

== Description ==

A Syntax Highlighter built in PHP and jQuery that supports customizable languages and themes.
It can highlight from a URL, a local file or Wordpress post text. Crayon makes it easy to manage Language files and define

**Planned Features**

* Theme Editor

== Installation ==

* Download the .zip of the plugin and extract the contents.
* Upload it to the Wordpress plugin directory and activate the plugin.
* Even easier, just go to <strong>Plugins > Add New</strong> and search for "Crayon". 
* You can change settings and view help under <strong>Settings > Crayon</strong> in the Wordpress Admin.
* Make sure your theme either manually specifies jQuery, or uses the version shipped with Wordpress (recommended). You should NOT print out jQuery manually in the header as a script tag. <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1535/how-to-dequeue-a-script" target="_blank">Enqueueing it in Wordpresss</a> will prevent duplicate jQuery includes (also bad) and will allow other scripts to be placed AFTER jQuery in the head tag so they can use it. If you're uncertain, just let Wordpress handle it and remove any jQuery script tags you find in your theme's header.php. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the Tag Editor? =

The <a href="http://bit.ly/H3xW3D" target="_blank">Tag Editor</a> provides a dialog box to add Crayons easily.

= How do I use it manually? =

<code>[crayon lang="php"] your code [/crayon]</code>
<code>[crayon url="http://example.com/code.txt" /]</code>
<code>[crayon url="/relative-path-added-to-local-path-defined-in-settings/code.java" /]</code>

You can use &lt;pre&gt;:

<code>&lt;pre lang="php"&gt; your code &lt;/pre&gt;</code>

You can use an HTML5 compliant &lt;pre&gt; (recommended):

<code>&lt;pre class="lang:php mark:1-4,3" title="some title"&gt; your code &lt;/pre&gt;</code>

You can also use Mini Tags:

<code>[php theme="twilight"]your code[/php]</code>

<code>[php url="https://raw.github.com/somefile.php" /]</code>

Please see the <a href="http://ak.net84.net/projects/crayon-syntax-highlighter/" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more details.

== Changelog ==

= 1.9.2 =
* Fixed an error preventing code containing HTML tags from being added using the Tag Editor in Visual mode
* Fixed CSS for Mixed Highlighting (+)
* Added a new theme thanks to http://blog.phiphou.com

= 1.9.1 =
* Added Assembly (x86)
* Standardised the toolbar buttons, now they use CSS spriting and have the same colour 
* Changed Theme CSS background to avoid conflicts with themes that affect TD tags
* Fixed bug caused by discrepancies in how checkbox values were handled in Tag Editor
* Fixed a bug causing $root variable to change on some setups, preventing tag editor from loading

= 1.9.0 =
* This update is the biggest update yet - highly recommended for all users.
* Added a brand new Tag Editor in the Visual Editor toolbar! <strong>Greatly</strong> simplifies adding code to posts in the Visual Editor. You can also switch between Visual and HTML modes to verify your code before posting!
* Added ability to decode HTML entities, so now you can use &lt;, &gt; etc. in the Visual Editor. But if you need indentation etc, you'll want to use the HTML editor for posts with Crayons. You can also use decode="yes/no/true/false" to set this for an individual Crayon.
* Added ability to decode attributes, which is enabled by default to avoid seeing encoded strings in the title, and also to allow encoded angle/square brackets in the title that would otherwise clash with the Crayon tag brackets if left unencoded.
* Added ability to use the class attribute in &lt;pre&gt; tags for specifying settings like url, mark, lang, toolbar and all other valid settings like in a normal [crayon] tag. This will ensure your &lt;pre&gt; tags remain valid XHTML markup even with Crayon disabled.
* Added ability to specify hyphen-separated-values in the class attribute of a &lt;pre&gt; tag to make them look like actual class selectors. E.g. &lt;pre class="lang-objc toolbar-false"&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;. The setting name is made up of letters and hyphens ONLY, the value is whatever is left between the last hyphen and the next whitespace character.  
* Added Scheme language thanks to https://github.com/harry75369
* Added ABAP language with help from Christian Fein
* Added a new setting: crayon="false/no/0" as an attribute or crayon:false in the class tag of a &lt;pre&gt;. This will ignore the &lt;pre&gt; tag and not turn it into a Crayon for those rare cases you don't want to use the plugin.
* Improved the method of finding posts with Crayons - now it will search through all posts for Crayons and save the ids in the options db. When the_posts is called, it won't need to do any extra searching on page loading and will already know which post has Crayons. Like before, pages which might use page templates will turn off enqueuing of fonts and themes to ensure they are always printed.
* Overriden Language File elements are now put first in the CSS class name, so the extended element can override in a theme
* Prevented capturing Crayons in the admin
* Crayons now use HTML5 valid markup
* I'm still sticking to the wrap="off" for no-wrapping preformatted styling - CSS doesn't do the trick yet: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/657795/how-remove-wordwrap-from-textarea
* Improved ajax handling
* Cleaned up the settings screen
* Line numbers now use UID in id to avoid duplicates
* Crayon CSS updated to use inline styles and never use style tags in the body
* Simplified the toolbar buttons to suit the minimalistic design of the rest of Crayon. It'll look badass with an inset shadow in a future theme...
* Plain tags are now just &lt;pre&gt; tags and don't contain the inline code tag since they are block tags.
* Fixed a MAJOR bug preventing previously captured Crayons from being applied to post content!
* Fixed a bug causing case insensitive Boolean settings to fail at times
* Fixed a bug causing a [crayon ... /] tags to be recognised as [c ... /] tags (added a \b)
* Fixed a bug preventing highlight="false" from working
* Fixed a bug preventing mouse events for showing plain code when toolbar is always hidden
* Fixed a bug preventing smart enqueuing from detecting if a Crayon was present before enqueuing resources.
* Fixed a bug causing inline tags to be surround in &lt;p&gt; tags
* Fixed a bug causing toolbar=1 to be regarded as toolbar=false from legacy settings
* Fixed a bug causing content to be specified but not formatted for URLs with no code given
* Fixed removing $ in font of ignored crayons like $&lt;pre...
* Fixed js .style bugs in < IE 9
* Cleaned up code for specifying attributes, NULL attributes are not passed as empty strings anymore. 
* The log looks cleaner now
* Now crayons are replaced with [crayon-id/] in posts before being replaced with the actual Crayon 
* If js ever fails to load, it won't affect styling, just functionality
* Added ability to use closed Mini Tags like [php ... \] when you're just giving a URL
* Added lenient spaces for closed tags
* Fixed element content text in XHTML to avoid capturing "" as strings
* Added Lithuanian translation thanks to <a href="http://www.host1free.com" target="_blank">Vincent G</a>

= 1.7.2 =
* Fixed a bug that prevented foreign languages from being initialised and used. Thanks to @west_323 for finding it.  

= 1.7.1 =
* Renamed Japanese GNU language code from ja_JP to ja.

= 1.7.0 =
* Added the ability to highlight multiple languages in a single Crayon! http://bit.ly/ukwts2

= 1.6.6 =

= 1.6.5 =

= 1.6.4 =
* Added user submitted Japanese language support. Thanks to @west_323!
* &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags are now captured as Crayons. This can be turned off in Settings > Crayon > Code.
* You can remove prevent capturing individual &lt;pre&gt; tags the same way as Crayons: $&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;
* This method of preventing the &lt;pre&gt; tag should be used if your code contains &lt;pre&gt; tags (nested &lt;pre&gt; tags) - otherwise it will cause conflicts.
* Keep in mind that &lt;pre&gt; tags should not be editted in Visual Mode. Crayon will display all code as it appears in the HTML view of the post editor, where you can make code changes and use the tab key etc. If you want to use the Visual editor reguarly and are running into problems, consider loading the code form a file using the 'url' attribute. 
* I have removed the ability to have spacing between the starting and ending square brackets, so [crayon...] is valid but [ crayon ... ] is not.
The same applies to &lt;pre&gt; tags (not &lt; pre &gt;). The reason is to improve performance on posts without Crayons by using strpos and not regex functions like preg_match, and also it's better formed.
* Fixed a bug causing Plain Code to display characters as encoded HTML entities
* Removed jQuery 1.7 from /js folder. Now uses the version provided by WP.

= 1.6.3 =
* For those still having issues with CSS and JavaScript not laoding, I have added a new setting in Misc. that will allow you to either attempt to load these resources when needed if you have no issues with your theme or to force them to load on each page.

* Added ability to use and define language aliases. eg. XML -> XHTML, cpp -> c++, py -> python

= 1.6.1 =
* Avoided using $wp_query, $posts instead
* Updated contextual help to be compliant with WP 3.3

= 1.6.0 =
* Added internationalisation with 4 new languages: German, Spanish, French and Italian
* These were translated using Google Translate, so if you speak these languages and would like to improve them,
it's actually quite easy to edit - just contact me via email :)
* More languages will be added as they are demanded
